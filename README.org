* Why It Exists ?

I have used kwrite for an long time; it's my first text editor on linux.

So, mainly i use it for quick writing text and works well;

Sometimes it has some issues; which didn't matter to me

and i want it to make like an personal editor;

So; jino was created for writing and editing text and it works well

With themeing and keybindings and i make it like an really personal taste for the editor.
